Maze 1:

- goes to the right and instead of going down to the end it goes upwards 
- this is because checks i = 0 first
- Stack pops elements by going backwards then finally finds end 
- goes longer way


Maze 3: 

- Despite the end tile being on the left, the maze goes all the way to the right side
- This is a valid move because it is instructed to check i=0; i<6; i++ 
- checks every single tile before finally going to the very left, last tile in maze
- again, goes longer way than other mazes
